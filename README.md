One liner: Creation of a digital platform for sharing and accessing exclusively produced Virtual Reality (VR) content, produced by artists or cultural entities, much like ‘WithinVR’ (description of what WithinVR is) or Ubuweb.

Project summary:

We want to create a curatorial platform dedicated to different artistic expressions produced exclusively in VR. The subscription system would be somewhat like Netflix or Mubi, with a monthly payment or a pay-per-view system.

Right now contents using VR enjoy less visibility and even reputation than they should. Most people believe it to be a gimmick or just something to be used in Hollywood films or video-games; yet, there are plenty of amazing artists working with this medium and that should be recognized.

We believe a platform like the one we are proposing, where artists can be showcased alongside curatorial content, is a must if VR is to be widely recognized as a relevant and important artistic language.

We want to use the NEAR currency to implement this platform, as we believe it’s the best way to bridge the gap between independent artists and cultural institutions looking to join the developing web 3 cultural space.

Not only this would push for more commercial use-cases in the NEAR network, but would be a blueprint for community-driven funding to become a part of VR artists’s methodology and engagement with other artists and the public.

In order to implement these ideas, we will need to focus on two axis:

    public-oriented platform, with VR content, access to artists work, interviews, curatorial videos and texts, etc.
    artist-oriented platform, with access to the NEAR community, project proposals, grant requests, p2p feedback and engagement, etc.

We strongly believe this platform would be a reference in the VR space, serving multiple purposes, like discovering new artists, work and exhibitions created with this technology, ask for funding or showcase new projects, and bringing thousands of people to the NEAR ecosystem for the long run.
We also want to help content creators earn royalties, so we intend to implement a model that rewards them for views.
